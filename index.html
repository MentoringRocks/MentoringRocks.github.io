        My name is <a href="https://www.timbourguignon.fr">Timothée Bourguignon</a> and <b>I am a mentee</b>. I am surrounded with <b>human beings</b> that help bring the best out of me. <b>I am also a mentor</b>. I have knowingly mentored half a dozen individuals in recent years, and hopefully many more unknowingly. I chose to help people and <b>accompany them on their journey</b> because I wish no-one would walk alone. I am convinced that every one of us is both a mentor and a mentee. Mentoring.Rocks is my attempt to <b>help YOU get there</b>!​

        <h3><i class="fas fa-user-friends padded-right"></i>Mentor & mentee?</h3>
        <p>It is easier than it looks, but even scarier than it sounds. You most probably already are both a mentor and a mentee by accident. I created this Email Course to help you realize it, understand the mentoring dynamic and make your <b>first steps</b>.</p>

        <h3><i class="far fa-question-circle padded-right"></i>What to expect?</h3>
        <p>Right after you register, you will receive your first Email. And then one more every week for 8 weeks. Each Email focuses on one <b>key topic</b> and takes no more than <b>3 minutes</b> to read in its entirety. But they take a lot longer to process. Each start with a recap' and some introspective questions. Then introduces the need for a <b>different approach, tool or point of view</b>. And ends with an assignment to complete until the next email, 7 days later.</p>

        <h3><i class="far fa-envelope padded-right"></i>An Email Course?</h3>
        <p>Mentoring is not something you can learn with a snap of a finger. Your understanding will <b>grow over time</b>. The Email format is very lightweight and uncomplicated. But it allows me to slow down the learning process and encourage you to make <b>small but necessary steps</b>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-half column padded">
        <h3><i class="far fa-credit-card padded-right"></i>And it is free?</h3>
        <p>All the 8 lessons are <b>free</b>. Just hit the button below to receive the first one <b>within minutes</b>. Isn't that a fair deal? Once you have completed those thought triggering lessons, the best you could offer me are the gift of <b>feedback</b> and <b>word of mouth</b>! Tell me what you liked most and what I could improve. Spread the good news and let others know about this course. Thank you!</p>
